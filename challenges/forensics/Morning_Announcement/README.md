### Description

An announcement was transmitted to all human-owned devices and androids this morning, it was also broadcasted over all transit lines, apologizing for a disturbance. There was no mention of what the disturbance was. Rogueware has come to believe that this announcement was a front for a secret message sent to androids. Who knows what affect this would have on abberrants as well. We have posted a bounty for the discovery if there was a secret message concealed within this announcement and the content of this message. If you find that there is a message concealed in the announcement, please send it to us in the form magpie{concealed_message}.

Thank you for supporting us in our mission,  
Sincerely,  
Rogueware Inc.
