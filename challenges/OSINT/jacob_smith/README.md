## Description:
We've been tracking down an individual who we believe is an important figure in Rogueware's operations. He's a multi-lingual genius who is behind many of the recent attacks. Our agents have managed to get only the following information about him: his name is Jacob Smith, he wears a shirt that has a big 64 with a white star and green background, and in conversation, he signs off with the phrase "one who hopes". See what you can find.

## Hints:
1. How would a chinese person write their name?
2. Third time's the charm
3. I heard you like the number 64 so I put 64 in your 64

## Solution:
1. Figure out that the language referenced is Esperanto, change the name of Jacob Smith into the esperanto version of that name and look in social media ( Instagram )
2. Find and scan the QR code in one of the posts on the instagram account
3. Once you download the file from the google drive, decrypt it using base64 , 64 times
