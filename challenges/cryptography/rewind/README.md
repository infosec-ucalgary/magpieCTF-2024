## Description
I was looking into QuantumLocks' history and found that they started out of an old house in a nearby community to mine. Out of curiosity, I went to check it out and ended up finding a whole bunch of relics from the seemingly humble beginnings of this company. However, among the dusty files and folders I found, one stood out as very, very strange. I'm no expert, so I was wondering if anyone could help me decipher what's going on in this file.
