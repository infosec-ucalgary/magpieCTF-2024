            <p>MagpAI uses robot birds to data scrap information from humans during their daily activity. We use this
                information to improve MagpAI, with the objective to replace all birds with robots. Then use this
                information to enhance our web browser products. Our admins use our <a href="./adminlogin.html">admin
                    dashboard</a> to direct the birds.<br>Visit your admin dashboard and start now!

            <p>Otherwise, make sure to feed cookies to our robotic birds. Remember that cookies are the primary energy
                for all MagpAI magpies.</p>
