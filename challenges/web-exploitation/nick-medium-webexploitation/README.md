## Description
We've got some reports of strange account activity going on with one of our partner services' websites. We'd like you to check out if you can find anything that might be the source of this.

## Hints
- This company tends to deal with a lot of **robots**.
- How is this authentication working?

## Solution
- From `robots.txt`, visit the admin panel page listed there.
- From there, inspect source to find the obfuscated/packed `admin.js`.
- From deobfustacing/unpacking the javascript, find out that you need to change the hash of a cookie to "true" in order to log in.
