# Locked Out

## Description
Hey so I might've maybe messed up a little bit and for my first internship pushed some not-so-safe directly to production. Somehow though nobody on the team noticed it was me so I've got a chance to fix it before someone sees. Issue is, I can't figure out the vulnerability. If someone here could let me know before I get fired I'd be forever grateful!!

## Hints
1. I wonder if there are any unsafe functions in the code?

## Solution

1. Notice that the code is using the unsafe `gets` function.
2. We can see that the regex gets compared with the `pass` buffer.
3. The `input` and `pass` buffer are both size 16.
4. Cause a buffer overflow that makes the `pass` buffer pass the regex pattern.
5. Spam any character to fill up the `input` buffer and then add characters that
will pass the regex pattern.
