# Locked Out

### Category: Binary Exploitation

### Author: Dante Kirsman

## Description

Locked out and desperate to regain access, you face a challenge:
you've forgotten your password. How will you regain access to the system?

## Hints

1. I wonder if there are any unsafe functions in the code?

## Solution

1. Notice that the code is using the unsafe `gets` function.
2. We can see that the regex gets compared with the `pass` buffer.
3. The `input` and `pass` buffer are both size 16.
4. Cause a buffer overflow that makes the `pass` buffer pass the regex pattern.
5. Spam any character to fill up the `input` buffer and then add characters that
will pass the regex pattern.
