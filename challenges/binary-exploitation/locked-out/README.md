## Description

## Hints
1. I wonder if there are any unsafe functions in the code? 

## Solution
1. Notice that the code is using the unsafe `gets` function.
2. We can see that the regex gets compares with the pass buffer.
3. The input and pass buffer are both size 16.
4. Cause a buffer overflow that makes the `pass` buffer pass the regex pattern. 
5. Spam any character to fill up the `input` buffer and then add a string that 
will pass the regex pattern to put into the `pass` buffer.
6. Example input: `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagive_abcde_flag`
